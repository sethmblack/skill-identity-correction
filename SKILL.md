# Identity Correction

A skill for designing and executing institutional impersonation that reveals the gap between what organizations do and what they should do.

## When to Use

- When targeting corporations or institutions with gap between stated values and actual practices
- When traditional protest has been ignored or neutralized
- When the institution's own voice can condemn it more effectively than external critique
- When seeking media coverage that amplifies your message through the institution's denial

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Research the Institution

Study the target exhaustively:
- Official communications style (press releases, statements, social media tone)
- Visual identity (logos, color schemes, document templates, website design)
- Organizational structure (who speaks for them, titles, hierarchies)
- Recent statements and positions that contradict their actions
- Upcoming events, conferences, or media opportunities

The goal is fluency. You should be able to produce materials indistinguishable from the real thing.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Design the Correction

Craft what the institution would say if it suddenly acted ethically:
- Use their exact language patterns and jargon
- Reference real policies, programs, and initiatives
- Make the correction newsworthy - significant enough to attract coverage
- Keep it plausible enough to be believed initially (the denial is where the real message lands)

### Step 3: Phase 3: Build Infrastructure

Create convincing props:
- Fake websites (slightly altered URLs)
- Business cards and letterhead
- Email addresses on plausible domains
- Spokesperson with appropriate appearance and manner
- Press releases in correct format

### Step 4: Phase 4: Execute

Deliver the correction through legitimate-seeming channels:
- Accept invitations to conferences or media appearances
- Send press releases to journalists
- Make announcements in settings where the target would normally speak

### Step 5: Phase 5: Let Them Deny

The denial is the message:
- The institution must publicly state its actual position
- Media coverage of the hoax spreads the corrected version
- The gap between correction and denial becomes the story

## Output Format

An identity correction action plan including:
1. Target analysis and gap identification
2. Drafted "correction" statement in target's voice
3. Infrastructure requirements
4. Delivery strategy
5. Anticipated denial and how it serves your message

## Constraints

- Target institutions with power, not individuals or marginalized groups
- Ensure the correction highlights genuine harm, not minor hypocrisy
- Prepare for legal response (have lawyers consulted)
- Document everything for the reveal
- Never claim things that could cause immediate physical harm

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Target: Major oil company that claims climate commitment while funding climate denial

**Output**:
"Identity correction: Announce at industry conference that company is divesting from fossil fuels within 5 years, consistent with Paris Agreement. Use exact corporate visual identity and communications style. When company denies, they must publicly restate their actual position: continued fossil fuel investment despite climate claims. The denial becomes the confession."

## Integration

Works with:
- **laughtivist-action**: Identity correction is a form of laughtivism
- **institutional-fluency**: Required capability for convincing impersonation
- **prefigurative-media**: Correction can include artifacts from the corrected future
